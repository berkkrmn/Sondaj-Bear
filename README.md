# Sondaj-Bear

This is a school project made by students at Yeditepe University.
This project is a collabrative project with Computer Engineering and Visual Communications Design students.

It is a fishing game where the main goal is fishing through an endless stream of fish and not letting our bear fall down by gaining points. There are obstacles that hinder our hook and blocking us from fishing. There are also sharks that eat our hook and decrease our hook supply.

The game is infinite if you can keep up fishing and gain points. Game ends when platform under the bear melts away because of not gaining points fast or by exhausting our hook supply.

There are also power-ups that help our fishing by giving us more hooks, fastening our hook speed, multiplying our score gain, etc.

Here is an example gameplay footage: https://youtu.be/ADdNiyN1mQ4
